# Installing CiiMS

Installing CiiMS is a very straightforward and simple process and utilizes several tools to ensure that your environment meets all the requirements necessary for getting CiiMS up and running.

## Requirements

Before starting the installation, make sure your environment has the following installed.

- PHP 5.5+
- MySQL 5.5+
- mod_php or proxy capable webserver
- PHP CURL Extension
- PHP ZIP Extension
- PHP MCrypt Extension
- [All Yii Framework Requirements](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/quickstart.installation)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

Once all the requirements are met, you can begin the installation process.

## Installation Guide

1 Install CiiMS through composer and generate an optimized autoloader

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev charlesportwoodii/ciims {path} 2.0.1
cd {path}
composer dump-autoload -o
```

If you want to develop on CiiMS, install CiiMS through git

```
git clone https://github.com/charlesportwoodii/CiiMS ciims
cd ciims
composer install
```

2 Verify that the following directories are writable by your web server user.

```
# eg chown -R www-data:www-data {dir}
#    chmod -R 754 {dir}
/web/assets
/protected/runtime
/protected/config
/web/uploads
```

4 Open up your web browser to the path where CiiMS is installed. Note, it's __HIGHLY__ recommended that CiiMS be installed either on the root domain or a subdomain (eg //blog.example.com, //example.com) rather than in a subfolder (eg //example.com/ciims). Most people have significantly _less_ issues with CiiMS when it is run this way.

5 Provide your MySQL database information to start the migrations.

CiiMS will attempt to run the migrations for you automatically. If you have trouble running the migrations from the web installer, see the [manual migrations](/installation.html#installing-ciims-installation-notes-manual-migrations) section below.

6 Provide information about your site, and administrative user

7 __Congratulations!__ CiiMS is now installed! At this point you can either click the "login" button, or refresh the page to head to the dashboard.

## CLI Installation

In order to facilitate headless installations, the CiiMS installer comes with a CLI based installer which can be run via the ```yiic.php``` command. To install CiiMS from the CLI, complete steps 1-3 in the preceeding section, then run the following console commands, replacing each value for the appropriate value:

```
cd /path/to/ciims
php index.php installer index --dbHost=value --dbName=value --dbUsername=value --dbPassword=value --adminEmail=value --adminPassword=value --adminUsername=value --siteName=value
```

## Installation Notes

### Web Server Configurations
CiiMS can use any basic Yii application web server configuration. For a list of examples configurations, take a look at [the offical Yii guide](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/quickstart.apache-nginx-config)

### Windows Environments

While CiiMS will run on a Windows environments, it's __highly__ recommended you run CiiMS on a Linux based server, such as Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, or CentOS. If you're trying CiiMS out, I'd recommend looking at (Vagrant)[https://www.vagrantup.com/] to use as a development environment.

# Upgrading

The following section contains information for upgrading CiiMS to the latest version.

## Basic Upgrading

In general - the following steps should be performed to upgrade from one version to another. Additional details will be provided if necessary.

```
git checkout {version}
git pull
composer install -o
php index.php migrate up --interactive=0
rm -rf web/assets/*
rm -rf runtime/cache/*
rm -rf runtime/modules.config.php
php index.php ciicache flush
```
## 1.x to 2.0.0

CiiMS 2.0 does not offer a direct upgrade path from the 1.x release branches. However it is possible to migrate your content and categories to a new instance using the following steps. Note that it is only possible to migrate your content and categories. Users cannot be migrated due to a change in the hashing algorithm used to secure their passwords.

1 Upgrade your existing CiiMS 1.x instance to 1.9

```
git checkout 1.9.1
git pull
php index.php migrate up --interactive=0
rm -rf assets/*
rm -rf runtime/cache/*
rm -rf runtime/modules.config.php
php index.php ciicache flush
```

2 Install CiiMS 2.0.0 as a separate instance using the guide above.
3 Run the following MySQL queries and export the data.

```
-- Categories
SELECT 
	id, 
	parent_id, 
	name, slug, 
	UNIX_TIMESTAMP(created) as created,
	UNIX_TIMESTAMP(updated) as updated 
FROM `categories`;

-- Content
SELECT
	id, 
	vid, 
	title, 
	content, 
	extract AS excerpt, 
	slug, 
	category_id,
	1 AS author_id,
	type_id,
	commentable,
	`password`,
	like_count,
	UNIX_TIMESTAMP(published) AS published,
	UNIX_TIMESTAMP(created) AS created,
	UNIX_TIMESTAMP(updated) AS updated FROM `content` 
WHERE 
	vid=(SELECT MAX(vid) FROM `content` AS t WHERE t.id=content.id)
```

4 Disable MySQL foreign key constraints and import the data into your new CiiMS instance

```
SET foreign_key_checks = 0;
-- Import Data here --
SET foreign_key_checks = 1;
```
